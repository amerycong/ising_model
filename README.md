# ising_model

As an exploration of mathematical methods in the field of physics, I created a 2D Ising model of m^2 magnetic moments (+ or - 1 valued) on an mxm square lattice. We ran a simulation to determine the effects of different temperatures and compare it to a theoretical, expected result.

Probably a lot of junk here, I tried many different approaches at first and forgot to clean up unneeded scripts...
